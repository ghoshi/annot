;;; Commentary:

;; Description:
;;
;; `annot.el' is a general (and scalable) annotation manager that works on GNU
;; Emacs.  It lets you add/edit/remove annotations, highlights, or even
;; annotated images on any file and manages them for you.  All annotations are
;; stored separately for each annotated file and get reproduced when the file is
;; opened again. You can even store annotations on non-editable files.  Because
;; annot keeps track of md5 checksums of annotated files, annotations won't
;; disappear even when file names are changed.
;; 
;; Requirement:
;; 
;; GNU Emacs 23 or higher.
;; 
;; Installation:
;;
;; Insert the following line to your .emacs:
;;
;;  (require 'annot)
;; 
;; Keybindings:
;;
;; * [C-x a]    -  add a new annotation/highlight or edit an existing annotation on point.
;;                 You can also use [C-x C-a]. (annot-edit/add)
;; * [C-x r]    -  remove annotation at point. (annot-remove)
;; * [C-x w]    -  insert an image at point. (annot-add-image)
;;
;; User Commands:
;; 
;; * `annot-edit/add'  - either edit the annotation at point, if there is,
;;                       or else add a new annotation or highlight.
;; * `annot-remove'    - remove the annotation/highlight at point.
;; * `annot-add'       - add a new annotation/highlight at point.
;; * `annot-edit'      - edit the annotation at point.
;; * `annot-add-image' - insert an image at point.
